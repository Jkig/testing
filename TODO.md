Now i gotta convert this working test thing into the working real app lol

The only manual messing around I have to do is:
npm run build/ npx vite build
pull both html files from public to dist, replacing whats there
npx firebase deploy


Currently, main branch is deployed, works with images, multiple pages+routing

main concern now is getting Threejs to work, i want to get this to work basically witout using it first, noting how to do it, then i have all the pieces needed

add way to navigate back to setup
